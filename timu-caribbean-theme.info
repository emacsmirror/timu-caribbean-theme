2 Configuration

Scaling
-------

You can now scale some faces (in ‘org-mode’ for now):

   • ‘org-document-info’
   • ‘org-document-title’
   • ‘org-level-1’
   • ‘org-level-2’
   • ‘org-level-3’

More to follow in the future.

By default the scaling is turned off.  To setup the scaling add the following
to your ‘~/.emacs.d/init.el’ or ‘~/.emacs’:

Default scaling

   This will turn on default values of scaling in the theme.

    (customize-set-variable 'timu-caribbean-scale-org-document-title t)
    (customize-set-variable 'timu-caribbean-scale-org-document-info t)
    (customize-set-variable 'timu-caribbean-scale-org-level-1 t)
    (customize-set-variable 'timu-caribbean-scale-org-level-2 t)
    (customize-set-variable 'timu-caribbean-scale-org-level-3 t)

Custom scaling

   You can choose your own scaling values as well.  The following is a somewhat
   exaggerated example.

    (customize-set-variable 'timu-caribbean-scale-org-document-title 1.8)
    (customize-set-variable 'timu-caribbean-scale-org-document-info 1.4)
    (customize-set-variable 'timu-caribbean-scale-org-level-1 1.8)
    (customize-set-variable 'timu-caribbean-scale-org-level-2 1.4)
    (customize-set-variable 'timu-caribbean-scale-org-level-3 1.2)

"Intense" colors for org-mode

To emphasize some elements in org-mode.  You can set a variable to make some
faces more "intense".

following to your ‘~/.emacs.d/init.el’ or ‘~/.emacs’:

    (customize-set-variable 'timu-caribbean-org-intense-colors t)

Border for the mode-line
